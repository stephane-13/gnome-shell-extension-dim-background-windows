# Gnome Shell Extension- Dim Background Windows - Version 7 for Gnome 45
A gnome shell extension dimming background / non-focused windows.
The brightness and saturation of background windows can be tweaked in the extension preferences.

# Compatibility

This extension has only been tested on Ubuntu 22.04 using Gnome / Wayland.
Gnome version 45 should be supported.

This extension shouldn't conflict with any other extension.
It simply adds an effect - a GLSL fragment shader - to alter the brightness and saturation of background windows.
It reacts on window creation and focus events as well as when the overview is shown or hidden. It doesn't do anything outside of those events.
